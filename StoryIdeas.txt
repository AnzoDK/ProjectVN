- Simple.
- Creepy undertones - creepy front, small hints that leads to the feeling of something being wrong (forshadowing)
- A kinda Doki-Doki, just not a copy - would be great with some uniqe ideas, that doesn't make it feel like a clone of Doki-Doki
- Wingnaning instead of being the center for romance.
- Doesn't show creepy undertones unless you activly go out of your way to make the game angry at you ;)
- *Prob gonna be free to play*
